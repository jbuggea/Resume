                <h3>University College London</h3>
                <h4>Msc Computational Archaeology 2016-2018</h4>
                <p>Mapping Spatial Data, Applying Programming Methods to Archaeological Queries </p>
                <p>Skills learned</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analysis based programming in Python and R - this was my first introduction to programming and so it was here that I learned the importance of debugging. The method of working is crucial and so the completion of several programming based assignments allowed me to establish a good problem-focused approach. I had tasks such as performing a regression analysis using a given csv. file, scraping a website for particular types of data and adding them to a searchable SQL database, and performing queries on said databases.</li>
                    <li>Good understanding of ArcGIS - I am currently about to start the second half of these pair of modules, however I have found it very enjoyable to see instant visual results from analysis. This provides workable output to adapt for all audiences.</li>
                    <li>Significant experience with location-based mobile app making in Android Studio with Java - this was a very steep learning curve however it was where I realised the degree of creativity involved in programming. The App involved multiple activities, fetching data from an SQL database (that I also had to create) and tracking the user's input and location. Whilst I felt a little overwhelmed at times the project taught me how to organise my projects effectively and run parts in isolation in order to establish an effective working method. </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Working with a Javascript Engineer alumni of my course in order to improve my working Javascript, HTML and CSS knowledge with exercises and projects, such as a pizza delivery site. She has also introduced me to GitHub and so I have a basic understanding of that too. </li>
                    <li>Following the Lynda.com full-stack development pathway in order to broaden my knowledge.</li>
                    <li>Exploring uploaded projects on GitHub in order to understand the practicalities of project building. For example a game of tic-tac-toe.</li>
